# yelpr

R client for accessing the [Yelp Fusion
API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3).

## Installation

You can install the released version of yelpr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("yelpr")
```

## Connecting to Yelp

To interface with the Yelp API, youâ€™ll need to register a [Yelp
Developer account](https://www.yelp.com/developers) and then [create an
app](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app). Your app will auto
generate a `Client ID` and `API Key`. Copy the value for the `API Key`
and save that value in your keyring by running the below code:

``` r
key_set("yelp")
```

You will be promped to paste your `API Key` in a separate password
window.

## Example

Get a list of all the restaurants that have chicken wings in
Charlottesville, VA:

``` r
get_yelp_search_data("chicken wings", "Charlottesville, VA")
```
