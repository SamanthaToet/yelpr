# yelpr package

R client for accessing the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). 

## Installation

You can install the in-development version from GitHub using the `remotes` package.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("SamanthaToet/yelpr")
```
If you encounter a bug, have usage questions, or want to share ideas to make this package better, feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/SamanthaToet/yelpr/issues).

## Connecting to Yelp

To interface with the Yelp API, you'll need to register a [Yelp Developer account](https://www.yelp.com/developers) and then [create an app](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app). Your app will auto generate a `Client ID` and `API Key`. Copy the value for the `API Key` and save that value in your keyring by running the below code: 

``` r
keyring::key_set("yelp")
```
You will be promped to paste your `API Key` in a separate password window. 

## Connecting to Google Maps

To interface with the Google Maps API, you'll need to enable the [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/). Once you enable the services, copy your `API Key` from the popup window and save that value in your keyring by running the below code:

``` r
keyring::key_set("google_maps_api")
```

Once your google maps API key is stored, you need to tell `yelpr` about your key. Run the below code to register your key:

```r
register_google(keyring::key_get("google_maps_api"))
```

## Example

Get a list of all the restaurants that have chicken wings in Charlottesville, VA: 

``` r
get_yelp_search_data("chicken wings", "Charlottesville, VA")
```
